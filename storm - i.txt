storm - i

i have an idea to show case some cool agentic use case in game, i want to build a two simple 
puzzle platformer, where behind every platforms in the game, obstacles agents have that 
access, users can create think of thier own custom puzzle to solve they can prompt the agent to 
build the custom level, agents craft a dynamic level based on the prompt each object will have 
colloider, prebuilt to it, agents pick the objects, i want to do it in godot does gdscrip allows llm 
integrations, and list down all the objects we can have it in the game, i want make it simple as 
possible and fun as possible

That’s a really cool idea, Arunprakaash — combining agentic LLM behavior with a puzzle platformer
opens up some unique gameplay and dynamic content generation.

✅ Yes, GDScript Allows LLM Integration (with Workarounds)

GDScript doesn’t natively support calling LLMs (like OpenAI, Gemini, or Anthropic), but you can
integrate LLMs in Godot using one of the following approaches:

1. External Python Server (Recommended)
Set up a lightweight Flask or FastAPI server that handles the LLM interactions.
Godot sends prompts via HTTP (use HTTPRequest node).
The Python server returns the level data, object placements, descriptions, etc.
This keeps GDScript clean and focuses on game logic.

2. Godot C# with OpenAI SDK (if using Mono version)
You can use .NET libraries to directly talk to APIs, but setup is more complex than the above
method.

3. WebAssembly (advanced)
Possible but not worth the complexity for now.

🎮 Object List for a Minimal Puzzle Platformer (LLM-Agent Friendly)

Here’s a simplified but expressive list of objects you can include. These should all have built-in colliders,
easily reusable in procedural generation.

🔲 Static Objects

GroundTile: Flat surface/platform
Wall: Vertical barrier
MovingPlatform: Moves horizontally or vertically
JumpPad: Bounces the player upward

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/34



Checkpoint: Save progress

🔧 Interactables (Puzzle Mechanics)

Button: Triggers doors or lifts
PressurePlate: Stays active while something’s on it
Door: Opens/closes with input
Lever: Manual toggle for multiple states
TimedGate: Opens for a few seconds when triggered

🚧 Obstacles / Traps (Agent-Controlled)

Spikes: Kill the player
RotatingSaw: Moves in a set path
FallingPlatform: Falls after standing on it briefly
LaserBeam: Turns on/off based on logic
Turret: Shoots in intervals or on sight

🎁 Powerups / Collectibles

Key: Opens specific doors
Coin: Collectible
HealthPotion: Heals player
TimeSlow: Slows down obstacles for a time

🧠 Agent-Aware Elements

These are controlled or modified by agents based on prompts:

DynamicBlock: Agents place or remove them
HintSign: Agents can write helpful hints here
PuzzleSpawner: A container object where agents spawn mini challenges

🧠 Agentic Puzzle Creation (Flow)

1. Player inputs a prompt: “Create a jumping puzzle with moving platforms and lasers.”
2. Backend LLM processes it and returns a layout schema:

(e.g., JSON: { "objects": [{ "type": "MovingPlatform", "x": 3, "y": 5 }, ...] })
3. Godot reads this layout, instantiates predefined scenes (each with colliders and logic).
4. Game world updates and player plays the generated level.
5. Agents behind the scenes monitor progress or dynamically assist/modify level.

🛠️ Suggested Workflow

Each object is a prebuilt Scene in Godot (.tscn) with script + collider
Use a LevelManager to read layout JSON from the LLM and instantiate the objects
Use HTTPRequest node to talk to Python backend with prompt
Make it multiplayer-friendly later, where users share prompts/levels

Would you like a basic Godot project structure for this idea (including dummy LevelLoader and sample
object scenes), or a sample JSON schema for agent-generated levels?

instead of user giving prompt to generate levels, i want the game complexity increases as the 
game progress each level let say we have 20 levels cause the context window limit ill explain it , 
first we give about the puzzle platformer context to the model system instruction, then we 
record the current puzzle platform generated as easy level then we record how the player 
progress the level each movement is converted to how the player thinks then feed to the model, 
then the model generates new level based on the player all the interactions generations goes in 
to the model context to better understand the player, how should we architect the game, the 
puzzle should be simple enough to fit in a single screen, no endless game, just a fixed set of 
components focussed on solving one goal, not moving platformer style cause limitation in 
context window, and the agentic side how should we architect the agent like plan, replan act 
agent, react agent what type of agents should we use for this use case codeact etc. ..

That's an excellent expansion of your idea, Arunprakaash — evolving level complexity based on player
cognition using LLM reasoning, not just difficulty curves, is deeply innovative and very agentic.
Let’s break this down into two parts:

🧱 1. Game Architecture
A simplified puzzle platformer (one screen, one goal) where:

Each level is generated based on how the player solves the previous one.
The LLM learns the player's thought pattern through movements and actions (i.e., play trace).
The agent then generates a new level tailored to be more challenging.

🎮 Core Game Components

A. Fixed View, Single-Screen Puzzle

No camera scrolling.
Grid or tile-based layout (e.g. 16x9 or 20x10 grid).
Only fixed set of objects used across levels (keeps context light):

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 3/34



PlatformTile, Wall, Obstacle, Goal, Trigger, PushableBlock

B. Level Scene Blueprint

Load via a JSON layout or LLM output.
LevelManager:

Receives level JSON (with metadata: difficulty, prior context).
Instantiates objects from reusable .tscn files.
Tracks all player movement/actions.

C. Game Loop

plaintext

Level N → Track Player Actions → Summarize as Thoughts → Feed to LLM → Generate Level N+1

🎯 Player Action Tracking to Cognitive Signals

You’ll need a PlayerBehaviorTracker:

Every movement, interaction, retry, and delay is tracked.
Translated into natural language reasoning (LLM-compatible form):

json

{

  "summary": "Player tried jumping over spikes 3 times, failed, then discovered movable 

block to bridge gap.",

  "actions": [

    { "type": "jump", "target": "spikes", "success": false },

    { "type": "push", "target": "block", "success": true }

  ]

}

This becomes part of the LLM prompt context:
Instructions + last level design + cognitive summary → next level generation

🤖 2. Agentic LLM Architecture
To support adaptive level generation based on player behavior, you need a cognitively-aware agent
framework.

🧠 Agent Type Recommendation

Agent Type Role in This Use Case
Plan-Replan-Act Ideal for generating levels, adapting strategy over time
ReAct (Think-Act) Good for simpler real-time decisions or hint generation

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 4/34



Agent Type Role in This Use Case
CodeAct Good if LLM returns level layout as code/data structures

You should go with a hybrid Plan-Replan-Act agent, something like:

🧠 Agent Loop for Level Generation

plaintext

SYSTEM INSTRUCTION: This is a tile-based puzzle platformer game. You are responsible for 

creating increasingly challenging levels based on how a player solved previous ones. Each level 

fits on a single screen.

MEMORY:

- Level 1 design

- Player summary: How they solved it

- Player traits (e.g. likes to explore, avoids spikes)

OBJECTIVES:

- Increase challenge (not just harder but cognitively richer)

- Use only allowed components: Platform, Wall, Spikes, Key, Door, Block, Trigger, Goal

- Make level solvable

Each new level generated would include:

json

{

  "level_id": 2,

  "difficulty": "medium",

  "layout": [...grid...],

  "goals": ["Reach goal behind locked door"],

  "components": ["Key", "Spikes", "PushableBlock"]

🧪 How to Keep Context Lightweight
Only carry last 3 levels + summarized player behavior
Use compact representations (tile maps, action summaries)
Fine-tune prompt template to get reusable results

⚙️ Tools & Stack
Component Tech

Game Engine Godot (GDScript + HTTPRequest)
Backend FastAPI or Flask
Agent Framework LangGraph, Guidance, or custom planner with OpenAI
LLM Provider Gemini / GPT-4o / Claude
Format JSON (for levels), YAML (for agent memory/config)
Data Store (Optional) Redis or JSON flat file (for tracking levels/traits)

Would you like me to create:

1. A prompt template for the LLM agent to generate levels?
2. A sample Godot-level JSON format + LevelLoader sketch?
3. The agent architecture codebase scaffold (e.g., using LangGraph or custom logic)?

Let me know your next move — we can make this very modular and fun.

now that i got a clear idea around agentic side, let think what the puzzle should be what are our 
game characteristic, etc..

Perfect — now that the agentic backbone is clear, let’s shape the game mechanics, puzzle identity, and
core characteristics. The goal is to keep it:

✅ Cognitively rich
✅ Easy to observe & analyze
✅ Fun within a single screen
✅ Replayable and scalable

🧩 Step-by-Step: Designing the Puzzle Identity
🎯 1. Game Objective (Win Condition)

Keep it consistent across levels so LLMs can focus on level variety, not rule shifts.

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 6/34



✅ “Reach the goal tile safely”

The challenge lies in how the player reaches it (logic, planning, timing, etc.).

🧱 2. Core Game Characteristics

Characteristic Design Decision
Screen Scope One screen puzzle (e.g. 16x9 grid or 20x10)
Fixed Goal Always reach the goal tile (placed arbitrarily)
Deterministic Logic Every puzzle is solvable without randomness
Low Twitch, High Think Focus is on decision making, not fast reflexes
Agent-Adaptive Game evolves based on how players solve problems
No Endless Loop Fixed 20 levels, increasing in abstract complexity
Replayability LLM-generated variations on same puzzle structures

🎮 3. Puzzle Mechanic Archetypes

Let’s keep components small in number but deep in interaction.
Component Description

Wall Blocks movement
Platform Standable tile
Spikes Fatal tile
Key Required to open door
Door Blocks path unless key obtained
Pushable Block Can be moved to create paths or block spikes
Trigger Activates platforms, opens doors, etc.
Goal End tile, must be reached

We can implement more advanced logic using:

Multi-triggers (AND gates, XOR switches)
Invisible paths
Time-based tiles (e.g., toggle every X seconds)

These enable cognitive puzzles like:

“Move block to avoid spike, grab key, return before trap closes.”

🧠 4. Puzzle Type Categories

Organize levels into cognitive patterns for better LLM understanding and generation:
Puzzle Type Description

Spatial Reasoning “How do I arrange blocks to reach the goal?”

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 7/34



Puzzle Type Description
Planning “What’s the best order to grab key and reach door?”
Avoidance/Trap Timing “How do I time movements to avoid traps?”
Cause and Effect “If I hit this switch, what opens?”
False Path / Deception “Red herrings or wrong keys”

🧠 5. LLM Agent Capabilities per Level

Level Phase Agent Responsibilities
Level 1-5 Build simple linear puzzles (intro, teach mechanics)
6-10 Add one constraint (door, spikes, false path)
11-15 Introduce multi-step plans and distractions
16-20 Require full memory of past patterns + logic chaining

This gives room for LLMs to "evolve" understanding of player decision making and build complexity
gradually.

🧱 6. Example Puzzle Skeleton (Level 1)

json

{

  "level_id": 1,

  "difficulty": "easy",

  "layout": [

    "##########",

    "#P     G #",

    "#        #",

    "##########"

  ],

  "components": {

    "P": "Player",

    "G": "Goal",

    "#": "Wall"

  },

  "summary": "Player just walks to the goal — introduces basic movement."

}

Level 2 may introduce spikes, Level 3 a key-door combo, etc.

🚀 Next Steps
You can now:

1. ✅ Finalize the tile set and game component palette
2. ✅ Define a difficulty curve or category for levels
3. ✅ Build a grid parser in Godot that can render layouts from JSON
4. ✅ Feed this to the LLM agent for generation logic

Would you like help designing:

A sample Level format + loader for Godot
A set of tscn scenes for each object
A prompt structure to generate the next level based on player moves

Let me know and we can start building it modularly.

instead of key and open doors, can we have goal something fun, but dont change our core idea, 
desicion making is the key

Absolutely! You can keep decision-making and cognitive planning at the core while replacing the “key
+ door” mechanic with something more fun, thematic, and open-ended, without changing your puzzle
framework or agentic pipeline.
Let’s brainstorm alternatives to the goal mechanic that:

✅ Require multi-step decision making
✅ Fit on a single screen
✅ Are expressive for LLM generation
✅ Make the player feel progression and satisfaction

🎯 Alternative Goal Ideas (Fun but Cognitively Deep)

1. Collect and Activate the Portal

🌀 Instead of finding a key to open a door, collect a “power crystal” to activate a portal.

Players must collect 1-2 scattered crystals to activate a goal tile.
Could include fake/decoy crystals (wrong order or placement).
Great for sequencing logic and traps.

Puzzle Thinking:
_“Which crystal should I collect first?” → “Which path is safe?”

2. Light Up the Tiles

🔆 Step on certain tiles in the correct sequence to light them up and open the goal.

Think of Simon Says + Sokoban hybrid.
Stepping on a tile too early resets the board.
Can be randomized slightly per player.

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 9/34



Puzzle Thinking:
“What’s the correct order of activation?”
“How do I avoid stepping on traps while lighting them up?”

3. Free the Companion

🐣 Your objective is to rescue a trapped creature or object and guide it to safety.

Push an object (egg, orb, animal) safely to the goal.
If it touches spikes, game over.
Introduces protection, path clearing, and detour planning.

Puzzle Thinking:
“How do I push this without blocking myself or breaking it?”
“What’s the safest escort path?”

4. Assemble a Totem / Construct

🧱 Bring scattered pieces together into a central “construct zone” to form the final goal.

Like building a mini structure: player must drag or push parts to a central slot.
Once formed, goal becomes active.

Puzzle Thinking:
“How do I gather pieces without getting trapped?”
“What’s the minimal number of moves?”

5. Color-Based Activation

🎨 Activate a sequence of color-coded tiles in logical or safe order to unlock the exit.

Each tile corresponds to a signal, like red → blue → green
Wrong order resets progress or spawns temporary trap

Puzzle Thinking:
“Did that tile give me a hint?”
“What was the correct sequence from earlier clues?”

✅ Recommended Fit for Your Game:

Goal Type Cognitive Fit Theme Potential LLM Friendly
Power Crystals → Portal ✅ Decision-making, pathing 🔮 Fantasy/Sci-fi ✅ ( JSON-friendly)
Free the Companion ✅ High planning + spatial logic 🐤 Cute/Fun ✅ (clear object behavior)
Light Up in Sequence ✅ Sequencing & retries ✨ Mysterious ✅ (reusable pattern logic)

🧠 LLM Agent Adaptation
These goals actually improve the agent’s design opportunities:

It can now plan:

“This player prefers rescuing the companion carefully rather than collecting quickly.”
“The player missed sequence logic. Add a visual clue in the next level.”

Keeps your core loop:
Player interacts
You record cognition
Agent adapts next challenge

Sketch a level format using one of these goal types?
Generate an updated system prompt for your LLM?

some more ideas

Awesome — let’s expand your design space with more fun, agentically-rich goal types that still
preserve your single-screen cognitive puzzle design.
Here’s a set of additional creative puzzle goal mechanics, all centered around decision-making,
planning, and player behavior modeling — perfect for LLM-based level generation.

🎯 More Puzzle Goal Ideas (Fun but Strategic)

6. Circuit Completion

🔌 Connect start and end tiles using movable objects or switches to complete a circuit and
power up the goal.

Place “circuit blocks” on the grid to connect a generator to a terminal.
Some connections may require crossing over dangerous terrain or puzzle locks.

Cognitive Load:

“What is the shortest path?”

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 11/34



“Which tiles to place where?”
“How do I reach and place blocks safely?”

Agent Benefit: Can reason about topology and movement patterns.

7. Activate All Shrines

🛕 Touch 3 shrines in the correct order to unlock the portal.

Each shrine glows when activated.
Some may be guarded by traps or require specific item manipulation.
Optional red herring shrines for false paths.

Cognitive Load:

“Can I visit all 3 without backtracking?”
“What is the optimal safe route?”

8. Time-Loop Puzzle

⏳ Reach a goal before time runs out, but you can “leave behind” ghost actions from previous
attempts (like Braid).

Each failed attempt spawns a ghost that replays past actions.
You coordinate with your past self to solve the puzzle.

Cognitive Load:

“What should I do now that helps my future attempt?”

Agent Fit: LLM tracks time loops and ghost paths for complexity building.

9. Unlock the True Goal

🎭 Two goals appear — only one is real.

Decoy goals mislead the player (sometimes lethal).
Use clues from the level to identify the real one (visual, logical, sequence-based).

Cognitive Load:

“Which clues are reliable?”
“Is this a trap or the real exit?”

10. Resource Puzzle

🔋 You get limited “energy” (actions or items) to solve the level.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 12/34



You have 3 blocks to place, or only 5 jumps.
Reaching the goal requires efficient planning and minimal waste.

Cognitive Load:

“What is the minimum number of moves?”
“Can I reuse the same object for multiple roles?”

Agent Benefit: Enables complexity in decision trees and behavior summarization.

11. Environmental Logic Puzzle

🌦️ Elements affect other elements — e.g., fire melts ice, water activates doors.

Push fire orb to burn obstacle.
Push water orb to grow a bridge.
Chain interactions to reach the goal.

Cognitive Load:

“In what order must I activate environmental elements?”

LLM Bonus: Symbolic reasoning, cause-effect modeling.

12. Echo Puzzle (Shadow Memory)

🧠 The level layout is visible for a few seconds, then disappears — player must remember
where to go.

After preview, only some tiles are visible.
Step on wrong tile → restart.

Cognitive Load:

“Can I mentally map the space and recall it?”

Agent Fit: Can learn player’s memory capacity and adapt layout difficulty.

circuit completion seems fun, does it involve heavy work on game mechanics

Great choice! Circuit Completion is a fantastic goal mechanic — it introduces visual logic, spatial
reasoning, and planning — perfect for your agentic framework.
Now to your question:

🧠 “Does it involve heavy work on game mechanics?”
Short answer: ✅ No, not heavy — if scoped smartly.

You can implement it in a lightweight, tile-based way that is:

Easy to render in Godot
Easy for LLM to reason about (grid logic)
Fun for players to solve

🧩 What Is "Circuit Completion" in Your Context?
“Connect a power source to a terminal (goal) using movable or interactable circuit
components (like wires, nodes, switches). Once the connection is valid, the goal activates.”

⚙️ Game Mechanic Components (Minimal Viable Set)
Object Description

PowerSource Start point of circuit (always placed)
GoalTerminal End point to be powered. Activates when connected
WireBlock Movable tile that connects two directions (e.g. up-down, left-right)
JunctionTile Fixed cross-connector or T-junction (optional, for advanced puzzles)
Obstacles Walls, spikes, or blockers that restrict wire path
TriggerPad Optional — places or rotates a tile when activated (adds complexity later)

Each WireBlock can have a direction type (like pipes in classic games):

Straight (horizontal or vertical)

Corner (L-shape)

T-junction

Cross

👷 Implementation Effort in Godot
✅ Core System (Basic in GDScript)

1. Tile-based grid logic
Place and move pieces based on grid position
Rotate tiles if needed (via keypress or touch)

2. Connection Check Algorithm
Run a simple DFS/BFS from PowerSource
Follow valid tile paths
If it reaches GoalTerminal → activate

3. WireTile Scene (WireTile.tscn)
Has type ("straight", "corner", etc.)
Has orientation (0°, 90°, etc.)
Knows valid entry/exit directions (N/S/E/W)

4. Visual Feedback
Change tile color or animate when circuit is complete
Optional spark effect when goal activates

🔌 Circuit Completion Flow

plaintext

1. Game loads puzzle layout (JSON)

2. Player moves/rotates tiles to complete circuit

3. On each move, check if PowerSource is connected to GoalTerminal

4. If yes, trigger success animation and load next level

🧠 Agentic Design Fit
Circuit puzzles are:

Easy to describe in JSON:

json

{

  "grid": [

    ["Wall", "PowerSource", "Wire-Straight", "Wire-Corner", "GoalTerminal"],

    ...

  ]

}

Easy to reason about:
Plan multiple paths
Add distractions
Evolve complexity (dead ends, rotations, limited pieces)

Easy for LLM to learn player behavior:
“Player rotates a lot → prefers trial and error”
“Player never touches optional pieces → ignores distractions”

🧪 Future Complexity You Could Add Later
Feature Description

Limited number of pieces Add a resource/planning challenge
Locked tiles Some tiles can't be moved or rotated
Toggle tiles Circuit must toggle 2 paths in sequence
Color-coded circuits Red power → red terminal only

🧱 Development Effort Summary

we can get the moving box to the button and holding it will open the doot

Perfect! That’s a classic and cognitively rich puzzle mechanic — and it fits beautifully into your system.

✅ Your Mechanic Summary:

“The player must move a box onto a pressure plate, which opens a door (or activates a
circuit/goal). The box must stay on the plate to keep the door open.”

This keeps the decision-making core, with light mechanics and puzzle potential. It’s used in games like
Portal, Baba Is You, and Zelda, and works especially well with LLM-level generation.

🧱 Core Puzzle Components
Object Description

MovableBox Pushable object by the player. Has weight.
PressurePlate Activates when box is on top. Can be held open or toggle
Door / Barrier Initially closed. Opens only when the plate is pressed

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 17/34



Object Description
GoalTile Final objective once door is open and accessible

Optional:

Multiple plates for multiple doors
Decoy boxes (light vs. heavy)
Timed plate that closes door after 3s

⚙️ Mechanic Implementation in Godot (Simple)
🎮 1. Pushable Box (Box.tscn)

Has a StaticBody2D or RigidBody2D with collision
Only moves when player walks into it
Snaps to grid

🎮 2. Pressure Plate (PressurePlate.tscn)

Has Area2D or CollisionShape2D
Emits pressed signal when Box overlaps
Sends signal to target Door object

🎮 3. Door (Door.tscn)

Normally solid (StaticBody2D with collision)
Opens (collision disabled + animation) when receiving signal

👁️ Visual Feedback

Plate glows or depresses when box is on it
Door fades or plays "unlock" animation

🧠 Agentic Puzzle Possibilities
This mechanic is deceptively deep and LLM-friendly:

🧩 Puzzle Variations

Variation Puzzle Thinking Required
Single Plate + Door Linear logic: find a way to push the box
Multiple Plates Order of placement, multiple boxes
False Plates Decoys that don’t open anything
One-Way Doors Push the box before going through

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 18/34



Variation Puzzle Thinking Required
Trap Reset Remove box from plate → player trapped

🧠 What Agents Can Learn

How the player chooses to move boxes (slow planner vs. trial)
If they prioritize plates before doors
Whether they fall into trap resets

🧠 What Agents Can Generate

Plate + box placement in increasingly clever positions
Lateral movement puzzles, false starts
Optional “helper plates” that only open shortcuts

🧰 JSON Puzzle Schema (Sample)

  ]
}

What would be the best prompt for this kind of summary generation

Great question — generating concise, cognitively meaningful summaries like that is key to adapting
the level intelligently via your agent. Your goal is to prompt the LLM to observe, abstract, and
narrate the player's behavior in a way that:

Reflects decision-making and strategy
Compresses low-level actions into high-level cognition
Becomes reusable context for future level generation

✅ Ideal Prompt Template for Player Behavior Summarization
Here's a refined and reusable prompt you can use with GPT-4o or Gemini:

goal is to summarize the player's thinking process and action attempts during a single level in 

a way that helps another agent understand how they solved the puzzle.

Here is the context:

- The player is navigating a single-screen puzzle to reach a goal.

- Objects may include spikes, blocks, pressure plates, doors, and other interactive elements.

- You will be given a sequence of low-level player actions (like movement, jumps, pushes) and 

their results.

Your task:

1. Write a 1–2 sentence summary that explains what the player tried, failed at, and eventually 

did to solve the level.

2. Extract and list each meaningful action as a structured JSON object: `type`, `target`, and 

`success`.

Focus on decision-making patterns, retry attempts, object interaction, and moments of insight.

### Example Input:

actions = [

  {"type": "jump", "target": "spikes", "success": false},

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 20/34



  {"type": "jump", "target": "spikes", "success": false},

  {"type": "jump", "target": "spikes", "success": false},

  {"type": "push", "target": "block", "success": true}

]

### Desired Output:

{

  "summary": "Player tried jumping over spikes 3 times, failed, then discovered movable block to 

bridge gap.",

  "actions": [

    { "type": "jump", "target": "spikes", "success": false },

    { "type": "push", "target": "block", "success": true }

  ]

}

Now generate the behavior summary for the following actions:

actions = {{input_action_list}}

🧪 Why This Works Well
It's explicit in expectations (natural language + JSON).
Encourages compression of intent, not raw logs.
Easily used as part of a LangGraph node, or intermediate agent chain.

✅ Tips to Improve Performance
You can also include an optional "level_description" key if you want the LLM to consider
environment layout:

json

"level_description": "The player starts on the left, must cross spikes, and reach a goal on 

the right. A pushable block is located above the spikes."

This gives more reasoning potential without requiring visual context.

Would you like a LangChain or LangGraph runnable chain using this prompt format? I can help you
embed this in your pipeline.

Let me know and I’ll tailor some more 🔥 ideas around that!

great, now i have timemap setup how to give the model the tile maps so that it can generate 
that form gdscript how can i get that information 

Awesome! Since you now have a TileMap setup in Godot, and you're looking to feed the level layout to
the LLM (for summaries, reasoning, or procedural generation), here’s how you can extract that data
from GDScript and prepare it in a way an LLM can understand.

✅ What You Need from the TileMap

At minimum, extract:

Tile position: coordinates (x, y)
Tile type: e.g., ground, spike, goal, block, button
Optionally:

Layer (if using multiple layers)
Orientation/rotation
Region ID or tile index

🧩 Step-by-Step: Extracting TileMap Info in GDScript

1. Get All Used Cells

gdscript

var tile_data = {}

for cell in tile_map.get_used_cells():

    var tile_id = tile_map.get_cellv(cell)

    var tile_name = tile_set.tile_get_name(tile_id) if tile_id != -1 else "empty"

    tile_data[cell] = tile_name

tile_data now holds a dictionary of {Vector2: "TileName"}

2. Convert to JSON (for sending to LLM)

gdscript

var readable_data = []

for pos in tile_data.keys():

    readable_data.append({

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 23/34



        "x": pos.x,

        "y": pos.y,

        "tile": tile_data[pos]

    })

var json_string = JSON.print(readable_data, "\t")

print(json_string)

Example output:

json

[

    { "x": 0, "y": 0, "tile": "ground" },

    { "x": 1, "y": 0, "tile": "ground" },

    { "x": 2, "y": 0, "tile": "spike" },

    ...

]

📦 Alternative: Grid Representation

If you want a visual/textual map (like ASCII format), you can generate:

gdscript

var width = 10

var height = 10

var ascii_map = []

for y in range(height):

    var row = ""

    for x in range(width):

        var cell = Vector2(x, y)

        var tile_id = tile_map.get_cellv(cell)

        var tile_name = tile_set.tile_get_name(tile_id) if tile_id != -1 else " "

        match tile_name:

            "ground": row += "#"

            "spike": row += "^"

            "goal": row += "G"

            "block": row += "B"

            "button": row += "*"

            "empty": row += "."

            _: row += "?"

    ascii_map.append(row)

for row in ascii_map:

    print(row)

This can give something like:

shell

##########

#..^..*..G

#..B......

##########

🧠 Feeding to LLM

Use a prompt format like:

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 24/34



“This is the current level layout in JSON format. Please summarize the player’s progress and
suggest the next puzzle layout based on cognitive complexity.”

Or:

“Given this tilemap structure, generate a new level with increased decision complexity but still
solvable in a single screen.”

🛠️ Summary

Use get_used_cells() to extract tile positions.
Use get_cellv() and tile_set.tile_get_name() to identify each tile.
Format into JSON or ASCII for easy LLM processing.
Use system prompts to describe how the map format works and what each tile means.

Would you like help making this a utility function or plugin you can reuse across levels?

for the first time generation there is no tile map right ? for that llm needs to generate from my 
tilemap how to give that, also possible group my objects as well like ground, moveable 
platform, spikes so that i knows for what tile is what

You're absolutely right — for initial level generation, there’s no existing TileMap in the scene, so the
LLM must generate it from scratch, based on your schema. For that, you’ll need to provide the tile
definitions, object categories, and layout rules.
Let’s break this into clear steps:

🧱 1. Define Your Tile Schema for the LLM
Create a tile-type specification you can send to the LLM. For example:

json

{

  "tiles": {

    "G": "Ground",

    "S": "Spike",

    "B": "Movable Block",

    "P": "Player Start",

    "T": "Target (Goal)",

    "*": "Button",

    "W": "Wall",

    ".": "Empty"

  },

  "rules": {

    "player_must_have_path_to_target": true,

    "blocks_can_be_pushed": true,

    "buttons_open_doors": true

  },

  "level_size": {

    "width": 10,

    "height": 6

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 25/34



  }

}

This schema tells the model:

The available tile types and what they mean
The logic constraints or rules
The dimensions of the level

You can even say:

"Generate a puzzle level using the following schema. Ensure it requires at least one decision
involving a movable block."

🧩 2. Let the LLM Respond in Grid or JSON Format
Example LLM output (ASCII):

shell

##########

#P......T#

#..B..S..#

#..#..*..#

##########

Or structured JSON:

json

[

  { "x": 0, "y": 0, "tile": "Ground" },

  { "x": 1, "y": 0, "tile": "Ground" },

  ...

]

Then you can parse this back into TileMap cells in GDScript using a utility (see below).

🧠 3. Group Tiles into Categories (Object → Tile mapping)
You can define groupings in your system prompt or config:

json

{

  "groups": {

    "environment": ["Ground", "Wall"],

    "obstacles": ["Spike"],

    "interactables": ["Movable Block", "Button"],

    "goal": ["Target"],

    "player": ["Player Start"]

  }

}

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 26/34



This allows LLM to reason in concepts like:

"Place the player near the ground platform, add spikes to challenge traversal, and a movable
block to solve the button-door interaction."

🧰 4. GDScript: Place Generated Tiles in a TileMap
Once you have a grid or JSON, here’s how to place the tiles:

gdscript

func load_level_from_json(tile_data):

    for entry in tile_data:

        var x = int(entry["x"])

        var y = int(entry["y"])

        var tile_name = entry["tile"]

        var tile_id = tile_name_to_id[tile_name]  # map names to tile IDs

        tile_map.set_cell(x, y, tile_id)

Maintain a tile_name_to_id dictionary that maps logical names like "Ground" or "Spike" to the actual
TileSet IDs you assigned in Godot.

🧾 Full Prompt Example
You're generating tile-based puzzle platformer levels. Below is the list of tiles you can use,
their meaning, and logical rules. Generate a 10x6 level in ASCII where the player must use a
movable block to press a button and reach the goal. Ensure it has only one solution.
Tiles:

G: Ground
S: Spike
B: Movable Block
P: Player Start
T: Target
*: Button
W: Wall
.: Empty

Rules:

Spikes kill the player.
Blocks can be pushed by the player.
Button must be pressed (with a block) to open access to the Target.
The player must be able to complete the level using reasoning.

Respond only with the ASCII grid.

✅ Summary
Step What to Do

Define tile types Ground, Spike, Goal, Block, etc.
Group them As "environment", "obstacles", etc.
Give rules E.g., “block can be pushed”, “button opens door”
Prompt LLM With tile schema + logic
Parse result Convert ASCII or JSON to TileMap

Would you like a working Godot script to place tiles from ASCII layout as well?

can you create a gdscript which takes a json and place the tiles accordingly

Absolutely! Here's a GDScript you can use in your Godot project to load a level from a JSON layout and
populate a TileMap accordingly.

✅ Assumptions

You already have a TileMap node in your scene, with tiles set up in a TileSet.
Each tile in your TileSet has a unique name, and you've manually mapped them to IDs.
The input JSON will be a list of objects like this:

json

[

  {"x": 0, "y": 0, "tile": "Ground"},

  {"x": 1, "y": 0, "tile": "Ground"},

  {"x": 2, "y": 0, "tile": "Spike"},

  ...

]

🧩 GDScript to Load Level from JSON

gdscript

extends Node2D

# Drag your TileMap node here in the editor or get it via $TileMap

@export var tile_map: TileMap

# Mapping from tile name (from JSON) to actual tile IDs in your TileSet

var tile_name_to_id = {

    "Ground": 0,

    "Spike": 1,

    "Wall": 2,

    "Movable Block": 3,

    "Player Start": 4,

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 28/34



    "Target": 5,

    "Button": 6

}

func load_level_from_json_file(file_path: String) -> void:

    var file = FileAccess.open(file_path, FileAccess.READ)

    if not file:

        print("Failed to open file: ", file_path)

        return

    var json_text = file.get_as_text()

    var result = JSON.parse_string(json_text)

    if typeof(result) != TYPE_ARRAY:

        print("Invalid JSON format")

        return

    load_level_from_json(result)

func load_level_from_json(tile_data: Array) -> void:

    tile_map.clear()  # Clear existing tiles

    for entry in tile_data:

        if not (entry.has("x") and entry.has("y") and entry.has("tile")):

            continue

        var x = int(entry["x"])

        var y = int(entry["y"])

        var tile_name = str(entry["tile"])

        if not tile_name_to_id.has(tile_name):

            print("Unknown tile type: ", tile_name)

            continue

        var tile_id = tile_name_to_id[tile_name]

        tile_map.set_cell(0, Vector2i(x, y), tile_id)

    print("Level loaded successfully.")

📂 Example Usage

1. Attach this script to a Node2D in your scene.
2. Set the tile_map property to your TileMap node.
3. Call this function from _ready() or another trigger:

gdscript

func _ready():

    load_level_from_json_file("res://levels/level1.json")

📝 Optional: JSON File Format Example (level1.json)

json

[

    { "x": 0, "y": 5, "tile": "Ground" },

    { "x": 1, "y": 5, "tile": "Ground" },

    { "x": 2, "y": 5, "tile": "Ground" },

    { "x": 3, "y": 5, "tile": "Spike" },

    { "x": 4, "y": 5, "tile": "Movable Block" },

    { "x": 5, "y": 5, "tile": "Button" },

    { "x": 6, "y": 5, "tile": "Wall" },

]

Let me know if you'd like to:

Support multiple layers (e.g., for background + interactables)
Support objects as nodes (like Player or Movable Blocks placed as Node2D instead of TileMap)
Use ASCII grid parsing instead of JSON

Happy to help with those too!

how to setup the tiles with name?

To set up tiles with names in Godot (so your script can map "Ground" or "Spike" to the correct tile ID),
follow these steps depending on whether you're using Godot 4.x or Godot 3.x.
I'll explain using Godot 4.x, but let me know if you're on 3.x.

🧱 Step-by-Step: Naming Tiles in TileSet (Godot 4.x)
1. Open Your TileMap Scene

Select your TileMap node.
In the Inspector, find the TileSet property and click on the tile icon to open the TileSet Editor.

2. Add or Edit a Tile

If you don’t have a tile yet, click "Add Atlas" or "Add Tile" and choose your texture.
If you already have tiles, click on a tile in the editor to open its properties.

3. Give the Tile a Name

With a tile selected, in the Tile Properties panel (bottom or right side):
Find the field labeled “Name”.
Enter a descriptive name like:

Ground

Spike

Wall

Button

Movable Block

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 30/34



Player Start

This name is what you will use in your JSON input to refer to that tile.

4. Access Tile Names in GDScript (if needed)

If you ever want to see the names programmatically, you can do this:

gdscript

var tileset = $TileMap.tile_set

for tile_id in tileset.get_source_ids():

    var name = tileset.get_source(tile_id).resource_name

    print("Tile ID:", tile_id, "Name:", name)

Or in more recent versions:

gdscript

var tileset = $TileMap.tile_set

for source_id in tileset.get_source_ids():

    var name = tileset.get_source(source_id).get_name()

    print("Tile ID:", source_id, "Name:", name)

5. Optional – Creating a Tile Dictionary Automatically

If you want to avoid hardcoding tile IDs, you can dynamically build the tile_name_to_id mapping like
this:

gdscript

func get_tile_name_to_id_map() -> Dictionary:

    var mapping = {}

    var tileset = tile_map.tile_set

    for id in tileset.get_source_ids():

        var tile_name = tileset.get_source(id).get_name()

        mapping[tile_name] = id

    return mapping

Then in _ready():

gdscript

tile_name_to_id = get_tile_name_to_id_map()

Let me know if you want to support multi-tile atlases, auto-tiles, or instanced nodes (like moving
platforms or enemies)!

Level loaded successfully

im cannot see the ground in the scene

If your level is loading successfully but you're not seeing the ground tiles, here are some common
causes and how to fix them in Godot 4.4:

✅ Quick Checklist to Make Ground Visible

1. Ensure the Ground Tile Is Actually Placed

If you're placing tiles via code (e.g., from JSON), confirm:

The tile name matches the one in the TileSet.
The corresponding tile ID exists.
The set_cell or set_cellv function is called correctly.

Example:

gdscript

tile_map.set_cell(0, Vector2i(5, 5), ground_tile_id)

✅ Verify ground_tile_id is not -1 or null.

2. Layer / Z-Index Issue

Check if your ground tile is rendering behind other elements or is in a different canvas layer:

Select the TileMap node in the scene tree.
In the Inspector, ensure:

Z Index is set to 0 (or above others if needed).
Y Sort Enabled is off (or properly sorted if enabled).
Visible is checked.

3. TileSet Might Not Be Assigned Correctly

If you dynamically load the TileSet or use multiple TileMaps, make sure:

The TileMap.tile_set is assigned.
You're not using an empty or incorrect TileSet.

Use this in _ready() to debug:

Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 32/34



gdscript

print(tile_map.tile_set.get_source_ids())

You should see a list of tile IDs.

4. Camera Issue

Check if your camera is zoomed in or facing a wrong area.
Press F while selecting the TileMap node in the editor to focus.

Also try:

gdscript

get_viewport().canvas_transform.origin = Vector2.ZERO

5. Lighting / Material Issue (Forward+ Renderer)

Since you're on Forward+ renderer on Apple M1, check:

Is there a light and the tile material is too dark?
Try temporarily disabling Environment → Background Mode or removing light nodes to test.

You can also try switching temporarily to Mobile renderer under:
Project → Project Settings → Rendering → Renderer → Renderer Name → Mobile

6. Check Tile Visibility Settings

Go to the TileSet editor:

Make sure the tile is assigned a texture and not transparent or 0 alpha.
It should be in a valid region of the texture atlas.
If using an atlas, make sure the tile has a defined region.

🧪 Debug Suggestion

Add this to your _ready() to check what’s being placed:

gdscript

print("Ground Tile ID: ", tile_name_to_id.get("Ground", -1))

tile_map.set_cell(0, Vector2i(5, 5), tile_name_to_id.get("Ground", -1))

If that still doesn't render, something’s off with your TileSet or rendering layer.
